# hyperparam_methods
Learning how to use various Python hyperparameter optimization platforms for machine learning models. 
We implement: 
1. Grid Search
2. Random Search
3. Bayesian Optimization
4. Hyperopt 
5. Optuna

Bayesian, Hyperopt, and Optuna all provide similar peformance. These should be preferred over something like a simple grid search. 
In general, experimental with the model first to figure out what scope you want your parameters to be before running an _n_ number of models. This will speed the process as the search space should be as tight as possible.
